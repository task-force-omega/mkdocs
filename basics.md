# TFO Command Structure

In order to understand how TFO functions during missions, one must understand it's command structure.
we are going to start from the top and work our way down.

### Ranks
TFO members all have military ranks, these ranks serve only as a designations for the combat skills, and a little bit of commitment and attendance. 
Since we don't have a static unit roster, it's very much possible that someone with a lower rank is still in command. Only in the absense or downed leaders, the member of the highest rank comes in command. When a rank is refenced in this guide, we are talking about rank within the Chain of command, and not the TFO rank.

## Missionmaker 

this is usually one/two person(s) who prepared and created the mission, and is ultimate responsable for a good experience/performance of the mission. 

### Briefing 

All missions start with a briefing done by the missionmaker for either the Platoon and/or Squadleaders or for everyone.
during such briefing the missionmaker is expected to give information about the objective(s), assign assets, and give other mission critical information. (insert hyperlink to briefing information). After the briefing  platoon and squadleader have an opertunity to ask any questions (unless stated otherwise).

## HQ

after briefing the missionmaker remains on base and will act as the highest level of the chain of command.
HQ assigns objectives, provides (non human) support elements, handles all technical issues and also directs the enemy AI if nessecary.

## Platoon element

The platoon element consists of the platoon leader and the platoon medic. Although this element is present on the field, it does not see much combat. It's main purpose is to coordinate all Squads under it's command. With the platoon medic present in this element, it usually moves behind the battlefield to treat wounded. Usually there is only 1 platoon element, but as the unit grows, it is expected to have more then one. 

### PLatoon leader
The platoonleaders answers directly to HQ, and acts as the highest ranking officer on the field. He coordinates squads and is responsible of forming a battleplan or adept it during the mission.

### Platoon Medic
The Platoon medic (or just medic for short) is the highest ranking medical personel in the operation. it is more educated and capable and effective medically than it's combat saver (CLS) counterpart and coordinates treatment of causulties with them. With it's position in the platoon element, it can directly coordinate with the platoon leader. 

## Infantry Squad
A squad is the primary asset of a platoonleader. a full team consists of 6 players, all with their own role.
Not all squads are setup with the same roles and can also be changed depending on attendence and mission requirements.
