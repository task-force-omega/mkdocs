## Tickets, or how to contact moderation

On Discord, there is a channel named "#support-tickets" available for you. 
To create a ticket, simply click on the "Create ticket" button and compose your message. This ticket is accessible to all admins and moderators. 

We strongly suggest that you utilize this feature instead of sending a direct message to a single admin, as it enables a quick resolution of any issues and ensures that all messages are logged for future reference.

You can use this feature for any topic related to TFO, such as a problem with another member, a report request, or even ideas to improve the team !

## I. Recruit Eligibility & Requirements

Welcome to Task Force Omega. Before proceeding to the regular chats and getting your role assigned, please make sure to follow the following rules. The rules will be split into 'Discord Rules' and 'in-game [Arma] Rules,' which must be followed. 
### **Please keep in mind our unit is 16+.**

### 1.1 Location & Time zone:

Potential recruits must be able to operate in accordance with Central Europe Time (CET). This may present a problem for international players. Our primary recruitment pool is Europe.

### 1.2 Username Structure:

Custom nicknames and callsigns are accepted but must be exactly the same on TeamSpeak, ArmA 3, Discord, and fit in with the following guidelines:

-  No numbers at the end of your name. Example: "JohnDoe012345" or "NewDivide47"

-  No ridiculous combinations of words. Example: "LoneWolfSniper"

-  No self-promotion of services. Example: "LastShotProductionz.TV"

#### 1.2.1 In-game name/callsign

Keep your rank in game up to date and according to our standards.
Please follow the username structure as given in the rulebook.

### 1.3 Activity Upon Enlistment

Upon enlisting in the Task Force Omega, new recruits MUST attend an event (after BCT) within 14 days or submit an LoA (Leave of Absence) explaining their absence. Recruits who fail to attend an event (either an operation or training) within 14 days will be discharged on the basis of inactivity.
You should join an operation once a month, unless you are unavailable for a long time. **(Request an LOA!)**

## II. Unit Regulations

### 2.1 Names & Callsigns

Beginning with your name, callsigns need to be short and easy to pronounce. No profanity is accepted in names or callsigns to be used on TFO servers. Rank needs to be clearly displayed in front of each member’s name. Rank formatting is simple and requires the rank abbreviation, capitalized, followed by a space, then the member’s name or callsign. No brackets, periods, or special characters of any kind (except on Discord, where ranks and callsigns are assigned by admins). Here is an example of proper name and rank format: *"PFC. Divide"*. The only deviations would be under the event we have two or more members in TFO with the exact same name or callsign. Do not follow the name by any tags or special characters. We do not wear clan tags.

### 2.2 Addressing unit members

When addressing members of higher rank, you must address them as either their rank or name. Be respectful to other members in this unit. You can call officers "Sir" if you want but it is not required.

### 2.3 Uniforms

Each Unit and Role is assigned with pre-equipped uniforms, weapons, and attachments. You may not stylize your loadout however you would like. If you’d like to adjust or add something, ask for permission at either staff or HQ. This includes custom texture modification, modification to nametapes, or XMLs. 
All TFO members must look uniform in order to prevent misidentifications and friendly fire in combat. In reference to camo types, these will also be designated by command staff prior to deployment depending on the terrain in the area.

#### 2.3.1 Unit patch

Don't use patches from other units. Also, don't use offensive patches.
It is also required to join our Arma unit.

### 2.4 Custom Faces

Custom faces and face paints are accepted but must be limited resolution images to load properly on the server and not lag other players. Vanilla Arma 3 faces are fine to use.
- Element leaders reserve the right to reject custom faces if deemed unacceptable at any time.
- Offensive content of any kind textured onto the face is not acceptable.
- Regarding large/entire face paints, neon and other bright colors are not allowed as they are too unrealistic and distracting.

### 2.5 Cheating & Exploits

We have a zero tolerance for any forms of cheating or use of mods that enhance your combat effectiveness beyond that of other players. Any mod that gives you open access to virtual arsenal systems (VAA), increase movement speed, or mods that enhance your HUD with unrealistic displays are **not** allowed. Arma bugs should never be abused during operations. If you encounter a bug (game breaking, or not), please refer to a leading role.

**Arma bugs should never be abused during operations. (Cheating is also not allowed)**

### 2.6 Recording/Streaming Training Sessions

Audio and video recording or streaming is strictly prohibited during all training events, drill days, and staff meetings unless you get permission from the Commanding officer.

### 2.7 Promotion Policy

Our promotion policy is based on individual combat and overall unit performance. Kills will not get you rank. Often times, element leaders will recognize their soldiers for all actions unit related, in or out of game, and recommend them for a promotion or award. Ranks are something to congratulate other members on achieving, not show jealousy and the "it should have been me" mentality. For a full rank list, please check this sheet.

## III. Unit Personal Behavior

### 3.1 Chat Moderation

While in TFO servers, you must always conduct yourself in correlation with our unit standards. **No exceptions**. Keep the chats completely clear of all religious, ethnic, or political debates and topics. Racism, sexism, or any sort of discrimination is not accepted at any time in any form. 
Do not make any remarks that could potentially offend another player. Keep in mind that our unit is made up of all kinds of people, from different areas and backgrounds. Do not take a chance by making an inconsiderate comment.

#### 3.1.1-a In TeamSpeak (audio):  

Soundboards, text to speech, bots, and or any sort of audio abuse are not allowed in our TeamSpeak. Push-to-talk is enabled by default and will not be deactivated for anyone, even per request. Playing music is not allowed on Teamspeak. If asked to stop, you need to stop. Do not move people out of the channels without prior consent. Keep the chatter on the radio minimal. There's no need for overly long messages or topics, keep the channels clear. If you must talk with someone while walking, driving, or getting transported or in any other ways, keep it proximity. Radio is only for tactical purposes.

#### 3.1.1-b In Discord (audio): 

Text to speech, bots (at the exception of the music bot), and or any sort of audio abuse are not allowed in our Discord. Please consider other players in the voice channel you are in. Playing music is allowed, so long as it does not annoy other members within a channel. If asked to stop, you need to stop. Do not move people out of the channels without prior consent. 
Moderating a voice channel is not easy. If anything happens and an admin is not in the VC, please contact administration and moderation via a support ticket.

#### 3.1.2 In TeamSpeak/Discord (text):

Keep the chat clear and spam-less. Any sort of all capped messages or repeated messages will be deleted. In some chat topics, it's only allowed to post specific documents or texts. Keep all the other messages out of these topics. Before starting a discussion, make sure you are in the right channel. If you don't know the right place for a certain discussion, either start it in general chat or contact staff to create a new channel. In case of any sort of disagreement between you and another member, keep the argument in the privacy of the private chat. If you must contact someone about it, contact one of the higher up staff and ask for help in private chat.

### 3.2 Respect

Respect other players 100% of the time. Never put another member down based on poor combat or communication performance. Never question the words of our officers or command staff.

### 3.3 Role Assignment

Everyone is assigned a main role in the squad roster. You are only allowed to differentiate from this with permission from an officer. Once the mission has started, stick to your role. Each role is designed for each situation. Disobeying orders (e.g., running off alone with a squad member unannounced) is forbidden. Follow the rules of your squad leader or commander. If you have questions, feel free to ask.

#### 3.3.1 Unallowed roles

Only pick the role you chose on the spreadsheet. Don't take a role you aren't allowed to take.

Reserve = rifleman if PL or Zeus hasn't said otherwise 
If you've signed up as reserve, you are a rifleman.

Missionmaker or platoonlead can assign you to a different role.


### 3.4 Lock It Up

Lock it up immediately when ordered to by an officer. We need silence to speak about important information that you would most likely miss if you were talking through it.
Also, radio comms should be minimal so the channel stays clear for important communication.

### 3.5 TeamSpeak and Discord Poking/PMs

Never poke or message command staff at any time during an operation. This distracts from our positions of responsibility and can cause accidents during deployment. Do not poke or message Recruitment Officers (@Drill Sgt.s) about potential recruits waiting in the lobbies. Our Recruitment Officers volunteer their time to help expand the unit; please do not harass them by telling them to do their jobs. More often than not, they are already aware of people waiting in the lobbies.

### 3.6 In-Game Text Chat

In-Game chat is only allowed for conveying non-mission related information during an operation (with expection for the missionmaker). It is allowed to be used during the briefing to prevent any interruptions. If you lose your radio and are unable to communicate with anyone, it is your responsibility to locate and rejoin friendly forces. Remember, this is a military simulation, not an instant messaging platform.

### 3.7 Join In Progress (JIP)

Never join an operation of any kind more than 30 minutes late without first notifying an admin or the mission maker. No exceptions. You cannot under any circumstances show up two hours late for an operation and expect to just join in progress. This is not join and play.
If you join an OP and haven't signed up, you'll be automatically assigned as *reserve*. PLT or HQ will then assign you to a role.

#### 3.7.1 Joining the mission on time

Join operations on time (or early). Except when the missionmakers says otherwise. **(Max allowed: +5 minutes)**
It ensure a better playing experience for everyone, as we don't need to wait for every one.

#### 3.7.2 Signing up

If you expect being late or there's a chance you may not be able to attend, sign up as a reserve role (reserving any other role is not allowed).
Don't sign off last minute (12 hours before operation start) without giving a valid reason. 

#### 3.7.3 Joining without signing up

If you haven't signed up on the spreadsheet, you are automatically a reserve.
Platoonleader and/or missionmaker can and will assign you to a different role if needed or available.

### 3.8 Help Out

Make an open effort to help newer players to the game. Experience levels vary across our player base. Some members have had the game for years, some members just downloaded it today. Insulting another player for being "new" does not propose a solution. Don't be that guy. Elitist attitudes are grounds for removal.

### 3.9 Community Representation

Remember that even when you are not in our servers, you represent the clan. Always uphold a positive standard when in additional private or public servers. Represent our unit well.

## IV. On-Base and In-game Rules

> #### ***REMINDER: IN-GAME RULES ARE IN PLACE FROM JOINING OPERATION UNTIL OFFICIAL ENDING OF THE OPERATION (according to the mission maker).***

### 4.1 Weapon Safety

Always keep your weapon on safety unless on an open firing range. No exceptions. Misfires and negligent discharges could potentially kill you or another teammate. Treat it as a real firearm; exercise caution at all times. This also includes any kind of grenades.

### 4.2 Teamkilling

Never teamkill on purpose at any time. This is a bannable offense in this unit. If you want to PVP, join an independent server. Keep it out of ours.
Don't return fire when being friendly fired upon, this only creates a bigger issue.

### 4.3 Respect (Continued)

Respect other players on base. They are there to practice. That should speak for itself. Give respect, and you shall receive it.
Don't bully others. (Take arguments out of game, or call an admin to settle).

### 4.4 Keep The Base Clean

**You should keep all important items (ammo, radio, medical, etc.)**

Keep the base clean. Put things back where you found them when you are done so that it is ready for the next person to come on and practice. Do not litter nor put items on the ground. You have boxes to empty your inventory.
**Don't pick stuff up that you're not supposed to pick up. Items like chairs, tables and gear aren't meant to be picked up.**


### 4.5 AT on non AT people	

If you are not an anti-tank role, you shouldn't pick up an anti-tank launcher unless told otherwise by a leading role.

#### 4.5.1 Using AT launchers on infantry

Light anti-tank launchers should be used on enemy vehicles unless told otherwise by a leading role.

### 4.6 Taking vehicles without communicating

When you want to take a vehicle, you should communicate this with a leading role.

### 4.7 AFK behavior

When having to go AFK, mention this to your leader and get into a safe area. It is your responsibility to take cover and regroup with your team when you come back.


### 4.8 Loadouts 

You should check your loadout at the start of the operation.
If items are missing, a leading role should be notified.

When respawning or getting resupplied, don't get more items than your original loadout had.

### 4.9 Continue To Obey Regulations

Obey the community standards that are clearly outlined in our Unit Regulations. These regulations do not "go away" simply because an admin is not watching you.
