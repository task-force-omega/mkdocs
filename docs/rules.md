#    RULES

## Loadouts	
### AT on non AT people	
>If you are not an anti-tank role, you shouldn't pick up an anti-tank launcher unless told otherwise by a leading role.

### Dropping important items you should keep	

>You should keep all important items (ammo, radio, medical, etc.) and not drop them on the ground.


### Checking your loadout and making sure you have all important items with you

>You should check your loadout at the start of the operation. 

If items are missing, a leading role should be notified.
Not resupplying to your original loadout	When respawning or getting resupplied, don't get more items than your original loadout had.
Gameplay	
Using light AT on infantry without authorization/notification	Light anti-tank launchers should be used on enemy vehicles unless told otherwise by a leading role.
Abusing Arma bugs	Arma bugs should never be abused during operations. (Cheating is also not allowed)
Taking vehicles without communicating	When you want to take a vehicle, you should communicate this with a leading role.
Using radio too much for no reason	Radio comms should be minimal so the channel stays clear for important communication.
Picking stuff up you're not supposed to pick up (Chairs, tables, also gear)	Don't pick stuff up that you're not supposed to pick up. Items like chairs, tables and gear aren't meant to be picked up.
Listening to orders from superiors or leadership roles	During operations, you should always listen to orders from superiors (higher ranks) and leading roles.
AFK behavior	When having to go AFK, mention this to your leader and get into a safe area.
Teamkilling	Don't teamkill on purpose. It can happen by mistake. Don't return fire when being friendly fired upon, this only creates a bigger issue.
Spreadsheet	
Not signed up people, joining	If you haven't signed up on the spreadsheet, you are automatically a reserve. Platoonleader and/or missionmaker can assign you to a different role.
People taking roles with the "might not join" note	If you've signed up on the spreadsheet, don't take a role (except for reserve) if you aren't sure if you can join on time.
Signing up, then signing off last minute without a valid reason	Don't sign off last minute (12 hours before operation start) without giving a valid reason. 
People not joining even though they are fully capable but choose not to	You should join an operation once a month, unless you are unavailable for a long time. (Request an LOA!)
Pre-op	
Not picking roles you can pick (picking roles you can't pick)	Only pick the role you chose on the spreadsheet. Don't take a role you aren't allowed to take.
Reserve = rifleman if PL or Zeus hasn't said otherwise	If you've signed up as reserve, you are a rifleman. Missionmaker or platoonlead can assign you to a different role.
People should join up on time unless told otherwise	Join operations on time (or early). Except when the missionmakers says otherwise. (Max allowed: +5 minutes)
Unit patch behavior	Don't use patches from other units. Also, don't use offensive patches. It would also be appreciated if you could join our Arma unit.
Names and callsigns	Keep your rank in game up to date and according to our standards. Please follow the username structure as given in the rulebook. (No ranks as part of a name)
Behavior	
Be respectful to everyone (no bullying)	Be respectful to everyone. Don't bully others. (Take arguments out of game, or call an admin to settle)
