## Target callouts: 
Tank = Self explanatory 
IFV = Light Armored fighting vehicles, (Bradley, BMP, etc) 
PC = Personal Carriers, APC’s Enemy transport, Trucks, etc. 
AT = Anti Tank launchers, either static or infantry with launchers. 

Procedure: 
In combat from now on. The commander will first address the gunner by yelling “Gunner” followed by ammo type, and then target callout
Examples: 
“Gunner! Heat! PC!” “Gunner HEAT BMP!” “Gunner Sabot Tank!” “Gunner Coax! AT Static!” 
Halt, Fire, Reverse
In an emergency, the command is given by the panzer commander. Immediately the driver halts and moves into reverse while the commander releases smoke, and the gunner fires a shot. 


## Gunner:
-Responsibilities
Always scan for enemies in your arc when no standard order has been given. 
Follow the gunnery drills in accordance when spotting or contacting the enemy, these are the location, type, and distance of your panzer. 
a. The location is best given in either degrees or compass headings. 
b. The distance is given in simple increments of 100m; however, this could also be done. with; near(<500m), medium (<2000m), far (>2000m). 
Fire only when given the order or when the engagement lock is open. 
Ensure due diligence where PID for targets are concerned, as to reduce the risk of fratricide.

Keybinds and Protocols:
Changing rounds from AP to HE Is done using the scroll wheel . AP rounds are Armor Piercing rounds and used against heavy machines ii. HE rounds are Heat rounds and are used against lIght vehicles and infantry 
Press "F" to Change the gun from the main gun to the machine gun and vice versa. 
Notice that guns are not in line with the sites; they are offset to the right. Usually, the centre sight is for long-distance, the first arrow to the right is for the main gun in close range, and the 3 arrow to the right is the machine gun
When scanning for enemies, the easiest way to identify the threat level of a target is by looking at the gun size. 
There is a way to keep your gun from moving with the tank when it moves by double tapping the ALT key.

The gun will automatically reload. With that said, after you have fired your weapon, you will call Out, "Selection." The commander will respond with an ammo type. If it is a different type than what was automatically reloaded, then change the type to the correct type and respond to the commander with "Loading ammo type." If the type of ammo that is automatically reloading is the same as the commander requested, simply say, "Loading ammo type."Once the ammo is loaded, say, "Loaded."
When you are given the "Fire" order, respond with "Firing," and fire the gun.  
When you are given the order to scan, scan, and reply, "Scanning." 
If you receive the order, "Target Stop" or "Hold Fire." It simply means to stop firing. You would reply, "Target Stop" or "Holding Fire." 
Target identification - Learn the different tanks you will be facing. This will make you more effective at targeting 




## Ammo Types for an MBT:
HE = High Explosive
AP = Armor Piercing
HEAT = High Explosive Anti Tank 
SABOT = Mainly used for Anti Tank
APDS = Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot, Also used for AT 
COAX = Machine Gun 



before and after firing:
As tempting as it may be to fire instantly after the gun is loaded, try to get rid of this habit, and only fire when the commander tells you to fire. (this only applies for Main Battle Tanks, or IFV’s) 
This is important so that in case of multiple targets, the commander can quickly tell the gunner to acquire a new target without waiting to reload.

Before firing:
The commander will designate a target, 
Traverse Left / Traverse Right 
When the target is off to the left or right side out of the gunner’s view, the commander will tell you which way to turn the turret. 
When acquiring the target: 
Gunner must not yet fire on the target, when the crosshairs of the gunner is on target, the gunner will say “ON” or “Acquired” 
After firing: 
As a gunner do not fire again unless told to. When the gun is loaded, the gunner will say “Loaded!” or “UP” 






## Driver:
-Responsibilities
Navigate in accordance with what the panzer commander wants, meaning do not move when no order is given, or do not deviate from path unless told so. 
a. The driving of the driver is consistent and does not fluctuate speed every so often. 
b. Repeat the orders given to you by the panzer commander
c. Moving is done either by the directional keys or some input device such as a joystick of steering wheel and pedals. There may be times you are ordered to "Block the wheels" this means taking your hands off the controls and using the parking brake. This order is used for safety during loading and unloading personnel.

## Static Positioning

*Picture*

Hull Down Position is the preferred method when in a stationary Position.
The Counterpart to this would be the Turret down- or hide Position which is basically the Tank being in a completely defilade Position.

*Picture*

This is an example of how not to stand in a stationary position.
The Tank is revealing its hole under armor which isn't as armored as the Turret or Front Plate.

Getting Ready Operations
After the briefing, stand with your respective vehicle and wait for the Platoon Leader's load up order.
Once Load up order has been received, load the vehicle up with ordered supplies, then load up into the Tank and wait for a radio check 
Once the Platoon Leader has done their radio check, wait for operation start orders.
During this time, commanders should give any Instructions to their crew that are needed.
Commanders should look over their orders, maps, and equipment and get comfortable. Your stress level is about to go up!
