This is a guide to becoming an autorifleman in TFO. 

## Autorifleman Role
An autorifleman is a supportive role in a squad, serving as a strong suppressive force and can bring up to 80% of the Firepower of your Squad. To do this properly the AR has to shoot short bursts (5-6 rnds) in succession in the general direction of the enemy. This means that an AR doesn’t always have to aim at an enemy to shoot. An AR follows orders from their direct leader as expected and is usually requested to stay back to provide cover for the squad. Since the gear of an AR is quite heavy it’s harder to push into a position quickly.
An AR must set up in a location where they can deploy their bipod so they can fire properly.  They also must be in a safe enough location to support their squad without being knocked out themselves. So, an AR should get next to or behind a rock. An AR should be able to support their squad at medium range (0-400m) it is however possible to support from further, but this will decrease efficiency. 
An AR is meant for suppressing a large quantity of enemies at the same time. This means that an AR isn’t supposed to pick off enemies one-by-one.

## Positioning as an autorifleman
An AR should be positioned near their squad or in an Overwatch position so he can provide covering fire and suppressive fire. The AR also needs a place with cover that they can use for mounting their gun. They should also use higher ground to their advantage when providing support to their squad. 
The AR needs vision of enemies, buildings with enemies or they have to know where shots are coming from so they can suppress those enemies. The AR can be left behind so they can support their squad from mid-range.
It’s very important for the AR to be safe as they are a key element of a squad. This means that an AR shouldn’t be out in the open too often and shouldn’t be clearing buildings.

| 5.56 LMG                      | This is the normal weapon for an AR. It’s usually lighter than it’s 7.62 counterpart, these guns also usually allow for reloading 30rnd mags for when the AR is out of ammo. 5.56 Boxes usually have 200 rounds and weigh less than 7.62 boxes. |
| 7.62 HMG                      | This is a heavier variant of the 5.56 LMG. This 7.62x51 variant doesn’t allow for 30rnd mags to be loaded. It also needs an ammobearer to carry ammo for the AR. 7.62 Boxes usually have 120-150rnds                                            |
| Bipod                         | Make sure your gun has a bipod as it allows you to set-up your gun properly so you can suppress more efficient.                                                                                                                                 |
| Scope with 1-4x magnification | The AR is allowed to have a 4x scope because they must be able to know where targets are more precisely so they can suppress better.                                                                                                            |


*Image explaing how efectivley supress an enemy*

In Order to Supress any Enemy Combatants you could encounter instead of just shooting the cover they are hiding behind, traverse from left to right or right to left slighty above the Cover in short Bursts.



## Engaging Air Targets
This should only be done on your Squadleaders permission because in can consume a lot of ammo very fast.
In order to engage any Thread coming from the sky with a Machine Gun you'll need to roughly estimate the targets Airspeed in order to lead properly.
Once you have done that start leading in front of your target in the direction its heading and wait for your squadleader command to engage.
Upon receiving said command you stop leading and just hold down the Trigger letting the Target fly into your Hail of Lead. This is one of the only options Infantry has against Air Targets and should be done in unison with the rest of the Team to maximize Damage to your intended Target.
