# Rifleman

As a rifleman, your job is to take orders and execute them as effectively as possible. 

Just like all players, as a Rifleman you are supposed to know all basic combat skills such as using cover and concealment, basic first aid, how to call out enemies, how to hold a position and much more.

Every member of the platoon is a rifleman first and foremost. In a squad, the rifleman is the lowest ranking or newest member of the team. This role is a great way to get new players into the action, without burdening them with additional responsibilities.

## Priorities

- **Listen carefully to your Squadleader.**</br>
To be an effective team, everyone in that team must listen to the directives of the squadleader. Be alert when they talk as they might have orders relevant to you. This also means that constantly talking (locally or by radio) will not be appreciated by other members, as it will interfere with their ability to hear the squadleaders directives.

- **ALWAYS identify your targets.**</br>
In the heat of battle it's easy to engage everything that moves. Sadly, not everything that moves is hostile to you so make sure that whoever you are engaging is not a friendly or a civilian. If you are unsure, hold fire, and ask someone else to help you identify the target.

- **Stick with your buddy teammate(s).**</br>
This fundamental low-level teamwork is an essential part of the squad, and by association, the squad's effectiveness. More information about the buddy system is covered in the basics <a href="/mkdocs/basics/">here</a>.
 
- **Scan for, spot, and call out targets.**</br>
Always be alert, always be scanning, and provide security when halted. 
 
- **Maintain appropriate positioning.**</br> 
The rifleman should generally be within shouting distance of their assigned buddy teammate, and often times much closer. Do keep in mind that bunching up will be a great target for a grenade or rocket. stay close, but not too close.

- **Maintain Rules of Engagement (ROE) and fire discipline.**</br>
Rules of Engagement dictate when you are allowed to engage a target, which is usually is discussed during briefing. If at any moment it is unclear to you what the ROE are, ask your squadleader, or assume it's return fire only. It's also highly advised to keep your weapons on safe-mode until you are about to engage.

- **Avoid crossing line of fire.**</br>
When moving under fire, make sure to move behind your teammates, and not in front. You don't want to get hit by a friendly for moving in front of their line of fire. Before moving to a different location, think about what path you are going to take. If there is no other option than crossing their line of fire, make sure to verbally announce that you are about to cross their lines.

## Light Anti-Tank
A variant of the rifleman is the Light Anti Tank (LAT). This is a basic rifleman, except the LAT carries a AT4 single-use launcher (or a similar single-use launcher), to engage light enemy vehicle presence.
LAT aren't allowed to shoot unless told otherwise by the squadleader, at the exception of **immediate and ID'd threats**.
Switching launchers/tubes or resupplying by looting enemies if subject to SQL appreciation and discretion. Always ask BEFORE.

## CLS
Another variant of the rifleman is the CLS. It's primary function is to make a wounded soldier stable until the medic arrives. although still a rifleman at it's core, it does have it's own section <a href="/mkdocs/RoleGuide/medic/#combat-life-saver-cls">here</a>.
