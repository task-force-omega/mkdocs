# Rifleman

As a rifleman, your job is to take orders and execute them as effectively as possible. 

Just like all players, as a Rifleman you are supposed to know all basic combat skills such as using cover and concealment, basic first aid, how to call out enemies, how to hold a position and much more.

Every member of the platoon is a rifleman first and foremost. In a fireteam, the rifleman is the lowest ranking or newest member of the team. This role is a great way to get new players into the action, without burdening them with additional responsibilities.

- **Stick with their buddy teammate(s).**</br>
This fundamental low-level teamwork is an essential part of the fireteam, and by association, the squad's effectiveness.
 
- **Scan for, spot, and call out targets.**</br>
Always be alert, always be scanning, and provide security when halted.
 
- **Maintain appropriate positioning.**</br> 
  The rifleman should generally be within shouting distance of their assigned buddy teammates, and oftentimes much closer.

# LAT 
Another variant of the riflman, is the LAT (Light Anti tank).

There's no big difference, except the LAT carries a AT4 single-use launcher, in case of enemy vehicle presence.
LAT aren't allowed to shoot unless told otherwise by COC.
