# CLS , or Combat Light Saver

For Medic, see <a href="/mkdocs/RoleGuide/medic/">here</a>

A CLS is primarily a rifleman, but with more advanced medical training than everyone else. Meaning, he can be a first responder on the battlefield, to try to save and stabilize colleagues, until the medic arrives on scene.

Even with this training, the Combat Life Saver is not able to perform advanced medical procedures.

One of the roles of the CLS, is to support the medic is asked to, and return to combat as quickly as possible.
