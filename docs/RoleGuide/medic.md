# Medic

This guide is written primarily for new medics,  but should have enough info for even experienced medics so learn something. I understand  many of this will not be carried out when the first bullets start flying, but try to keep any of it in the back of your head.

Before we start talking about the medical information I would like to start covering some basic ground rules.

## Safety

Before providing any medical assistance one should always care about the safety for yourself first.
This is one of the first and most important rule for any first responder in any field.
You cannot help anyone if you're shot yourself; this means that you might also need to deal with the threat first, and provide medical assistance later.
Medical assistance should only be provided in a relatively safe spot; this means getting some hard cover between yourself and your enemy. Think of your environment like walls, hills and rocks but there is  also cover that you can create: think of vehicles and trenches. if there is no hard cover available  nearby you can also use  currency for smoke grenades & bushes. If all above is not possible, contact your squad leader/ team leader.
In order to remain in a safe position you are also going to need covering fire.  I've seen countless scenarios where someone is shot and everyone rushes over to become a medic.  your job as a medic is to send them away as fast as possible and let them cover your position.

## Medics within TFO

As discussed above the role we call medic is a hybrid of a first responder and a paramedic. because of this there isn't a clear defined position within the squad like this within any army.
Therefore we can have our own interpretation of how this role can be used effectively.
Casualty collection point
Normally there would be different classes of medical personnel with different roles.

### Combat lifesaver (CLS)

 This soldier is part of the squad and as the name suggests this is probably the first one to arrive at a wounded soldier.  His job is to stabilise the soldier as fast as possible,  and  make sure they are either good to go or are stable enough to be medivaced.<br>
 Full role presentation and loadout is available <a href="/mkdocs/RoleGuide/cls/">here</a>.

### Medic

This officer is part of the command structure and operates behind the Frontline at a casualty collection point.  His primary job will be patching up soldiers  back to full health so they are ready to be redeployed.

Due to the smaller size of Task Force Omega we have chosen to combine these roles,
but as we are growing this might be coming in to play more.

It's recommended for all squad leaders to set up a casualty collection point before any attack. This would be  a location close to the frontline but away from any immediate danger. If squad size allows it it is recommended to have at least one soldier here to cover the position. Any heavy casualties are to be brought here as fast as possible.

ideally the medic would stick close to the squad leader and would only leave his side when ordered to.
Evaluation phase
 Alright, so the first bullets start flying and one of your fellow squad members got shot.
The first priority should be to call out who got shot and where to your squad leader. Sometimes squad leaders are in a much better position to rescue wounded soldiers than a medic.
Right after this the evaluation phase starts: is the soldier simply wounded or unconscious as well?

Wounded
 right after your figured out that the soldier is wounded another evaluation is in order:
 Is the wounded soldier able to move to a safer spot himself?  This can be obstructed by for example heavy fire or being crippled by the wound.  The answer to this question can easily be discovered by asking the wounded soldier.

unconscious
 right after your figured out that the soldier is unconscious another evaluation is in order:
Is the wounded soldier in an unsafe spot? The first order of business is to get them out of there. try dragging them to cover, or let someone close to the unconscious soldier do that for you. Picking someone up and carrying them over to a safe spot is usually a bad idea. The process of getting someone on your shoulders takes way too long Under Fire, Carrying can be a good idea when you need to move an unconscious soldier  from a position where you already have cover. A combination of both techniques can be applied as well,  for example: Drag a wounded soldier  from an unsafe position to cover followed up by  picking them up and carrying  them to a medic-post.
Equipment
In this chapter we are going to discuss the actual medical process. First we are going to discuss all the equipment you have available and after that we are going to discuss a few  scenarios.

## CPR

Let's start with the Wikipedia description for CPR:

“Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function until further measures are taken to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest.”

CPR creates an Artificial circulation in the patient in case there is a cardiac arrest.  So basically CPR is creating blood flow when the Patient's heart is unable to. It's also important noting that checking for a hard rate while CPR is going is always going to result in at least a low heart rate due to chest compressions. Checking for a heart rate on a limb with tourniquets is useless and will result in no pulse.
CPR by itself is not going to wake up an unconscious patient; a stable blood pressure is. Anyone can perform CPR and therefore as a medic you should assign someone else to do it. This will leave you to perform other medical assistance. To stabilise the wounds and restore blood pressure. CPR is only effective to restart the heart rate, after a patient has a heart rate (no matter how low) performing CPR is useless.
If a patient has no heartrate an invisible timer will start running, and you have 5 min to get a heart rate going, or the patient dies.
Tourniquets
Wound treatments should usually be executed in this order:  head > torso > limbs.
In case of heavy wounds on a limb a priority could be to apply a tourniquet on this limb. A tourniquet will fully stop any bleeding on the applied limb until removed. This will give you time to stabilize other body parts. After applying  tourniquets to the limbs and bandages to the head or torso and IV with saline can be applied.  Although  the pressure provided  by a tourniquet is great for stopping blood flowing out of the body,  that same  pressure will also block any saline  from flowing in, therefore an IV should only be placed on a limb without a tourniquet. While these magic bloodstoppers are great, they also are considered painful after 2 minutes.
Tip: whoever removes the tourniquets gets to keep it. So reclaim your tourniquets or you might find yourself empty handed!

To treat these injuries, you have four types of bandages, tourniquets and a splint at your disposal:

Basic: A medium-effect, medium-sealing bandage with medium delay for your every-day needs. It's the averagest of averages. Use on lower priorities.
Packing: Identical effect to basics, high chance to reopen, but excellent delay until a wound bothers you again. Basically an in-combat ‘fix now, medic later’ solution. A rifleman's best friend.
Elastic: Highest effect, worst chance to reopen, lowest delay. These are great to get through an emergency, but otherwise inefficient.
QuikClot: Lowest effect, lowest chance to reopen, medium delay. Its low effect means it’s great for small wounds, but needs substantial volume for large wounds; then used in calm situations with a large supply
Tourniquet: Stops bleeding by cutting off blood flow to the limb. Becomes painful after 2 minutes. Blocks injections and vitals. Not applicable to head or torso.


Choosing bandages
In an ideal situation you will apply the type bandages with the highest effectiveness per wound.
But in a combat situation, time is of the essence, and that might need you to “slap” a bandage on there as fast as you can. Which particular bandage that should be is very debatable. Elastic bandages are quick and very effective, but they tend to reopen fast, this however is no problem for a medic, since you have the option to stitch wounds up before they reopen.


## Fractures

Limbs can be fractured. Velocity wounds, Avulsions and crush wounds usually occur at the same time. Fractures cause pain, increased weapon sway (when arms) or inability to jog or run forcing the player into a limp (when legs). Fractures in ACE3 are themselves not fatal. So are far lower on the priority list in regards to treatment. Focus on stabilizing the patient first, then once stable, apply a splint to their fractured limb.

Advanced fractures makes it a bit harder for medics and CLS to treat on the field.

There is now 3 types of fractures, depicted below: 
For two of them, an IV of Lorazepam (if the patient is concious), and then Etomidate (reapply every 90 seconds) is necessary to relieve the pain caused by the treatment of the fracture. (The simple fracture just need a dose of morphine)

- Compound fracture:

- Inspect fracture
- Incision (uses 1 scalpel)
- Expose (with the retractor)
- Irrigate wound (uses 1 250ml Saline)
- Open reduction (uses 1 bone plate)

- Comminuted  fracture:
- Inspect fracture
- Incision (uses 1 scalpel)
- Expose (with the retractor)
- Clamp (with the clamp)
- Open reduction (uses 1 bone plate)

- Simple fracture:
-- Inspect fracture
-- Push Morphine
-- Perform closed reduction

When treatment is finished, a Flumazenil IV is required to remove the sedation. (Except for the simple fracture)
You can then reorient the patient to wake him up.


Splints: An instant fix to fractures. (Used in case of emergency by the SQL. Not recommended, unless there is no medic on the team)


## Auto injectors

### Morphine

Time to max effect: 30 seconds
Drastically lowers pain
Reduces heart rate
Low HR: between -10 and -20
Normal HR: between -10 and -30
High HR: between -10 and -35
Dilates blood vessels, which drops blood pressure
If your patient is critical, do not inject morphine before stabilising them
4 injections to overdose (but will knock-out any healthy soldier with 3 injections)
Lingers 30 minutes
Does not affect the wake-up chance of an unconscious patiënt.

### Epinephrine

Time to max effect: 10 seconds
Increases heart rate
Low HR: between 10 and 20
Normal HR: between 10 and 50
High HR: between 10 and 40
10 injections to overdose
Lingers 2 minutes
Does affect the wake-up chance of an unconscious patiënt.

### Adenosine

Time to max effect: 15 seconds
Decreases heart rate
Low HR: between -7 and -10
Normal HR: between -15 and -30
High HR: between -15 and -35
6 injections to overdose
Lingers 2 minutes
Don't bother with these. In real life they are used to stabilise a heart rate, but there is no such system in ace medical. They can counter epi overdose. But since you will only overdose after 10 injections, it's really not worth it. If you really want, you should carry a maximum of 1.

## Triage

In order to be effective as a medic you should start to assess these priorities as good and as fast as you can.
For example: a heart rate is not going to do any good if the patient has already bled out on the floor. 
It also matters greatly whenever you are alone or with a buddy.


Evaluation of the location, is it safe to treat multiple wounded?
Stabilize or ask team member to stabilized the most critical cases while treating the minor cases first
If possible, ask squad members to assign a triage card to the wounded.

## Gear
