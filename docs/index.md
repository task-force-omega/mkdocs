## TFO, who we are

Usually referred as TFO (established in 2013), **Task Force Omega** is an international Arma 3 semi-milsim unit based in Europe, but with members from all over the world, with a chill and friendly community. <br>Although we like to joke around and have fun, a more serious and focused gameplay is asked during ops. 

We welcome everyone, from new to experienced players, with the sole exception of the minimum age being 16+. Outside ops, we like to play many other games or game-modes together (Antistasi, Mike Force, DCS, Ready or Not, Ground Branch, Insurgency...).

Our campaigns are custom made by our mission-makers, which themes can vary from special operations to (un)conventional warfare, Star Wars, Vietnam, SCP, Cold War, Halo and more (all eras, all factions, real life based or fictional). <br>Depending on the mission, various supports can be available (JTAC, CAS, Heli, Armor, Artillery, Sniper...).

All new players are required to complete our Basic Combat Training, which introduce Arma/mods mechanics and how the unit operate. We do not request a full time attendance, life comes first, but a minimum per month is asked in order to give everyone the best experience possible ! <br>We do not forbid people from having multiple units, as long as it doesn't interfere with TFO's missions.
