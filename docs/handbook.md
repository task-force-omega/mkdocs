# General attitude and approach

You are part of a bigger picture and a member of a team. In Task Force Omega, we encourage people to keep teamplay in mind.

Every squad will be tasked with something, and it isnâ€™t your job to second guess your squad leader or to carry out tasks given to other squads. 

You will not have the bigger picture if you do not have access to command net. 
So, do not take it upon yourself to implement your own ideas without the say so of the squad leader.

**You need to think and prepare before you act.**

# Basic DO's and DON'Ts

It really is an abridged version of Task Force Omega rules, available <a href="/mkdocs/rulebook/">here</a>.

## DO

- Respect fellow players, no matter the circumstance
- Stay close to your group, unless told otherwise
- If you have an issue, speak to an admin, don't try to solve it yourself
- Carry out the orders given to you by your squad leaders
- Focus, think, and prepare before you act


## DON'T

- Initiate contact without the say so of the squad leader (apply ROE)
- Scavenge bodies for equipment unless asked to do so
- Take enemy weapons without permission
- Spam markers on the map
- Respond to a teamkill, by teamkilling

# SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)

Although SOP is covered during your **B**asic **C**ombat **T**raining, a refresher is always welcome.

# ROE

This is as much a mindset as it is a rule of engagement.

In other words, if the ROE is red, you should be doing everything in your power to remain covert and unseen.
