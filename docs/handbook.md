# Task Force Omega player's handbook

> **This is a document designed to accompany the Task Force Omega Mission Series.** 
> 
> *In it, you will find a quick reference for some of the most basic information you will need in order to function effectively on the TFO Server.*

## General attitude and approach

You are part of a bigger picture and a member of a team. In Task Force Omega, we encourage people to keep teamplay in mind.

Every squad will be tasked with something, and it isn’t your job to second guess your squad leader or to carry out tasks given to other squads. 

You will not have the bigger picture if you do not have access to command net. 
So, do not take it upon yourself to implement your own ideas without the say so of the squad leader.

**You need to think and prepare before you act.**

## Basic DO's and DON'Ts

It really is an abridged version of Task Force Omega rules, available <a href="/mkdocs/rulebook/">here</a>.

### DO

- Respect fellow players, no matter the circumstance
- Stay close to your group, unless told otherwise
- If you have an issue, speak to an admin, don't try to solve it yourself
- Carry out the orders given to you by your squad leaders
- Focus, think, and prepare before you act


### DON'T

- Initiate contact without the say so of the squad leader (apply <a href="/mkdocs/handbook/#roe">ROE</a>)
- Scavenge bodies for equipment unless asked to do so
- Take enemy weapons without permission
- Spam markers on the map
- Respond to a teamkill, by teamkilling

## SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)

Although SOP is covered during your **B**asic **C**ombat **T**raining, a refresher is always welcome.

## ROE

This is as much a mindset as it is a rule of engagement.

In other words, if the ROE is red, you should be doing everything in your power to remain covert and unseen.

## Advanced Combat Radio Environment 2 (ACRE2) Usage


In order to achieve the best tactical experience in Arma3, Task Force Omega uses ACRE2 as the main radio communication tool during the events.

*As it is installed by Steam, the add-on will be added to TeamSpeak plugins library automatically.*

(all below is WIP)
### Brevity and clean communications

Once the conversation has been initiated, keep your message simple and short. Think of what you’re going to say before you begin to transmit over the radios, do not “umm” and “uhh” over the radio. Keep it brief, no more than 10-15 seconds maximum. 

If you lose your train of thoughts while speaking over radio, simply state “Wait one” and take a moment to collect your thoughts before re-initiating the conversation. Also stay out of the coms if there are no important things, use direct chat. 

Remember, keep it brief and clear, keep it brief and clear, and keep it brief and clear.

### Acknowledging speakers

Make sure you always acknowledge the person who is speaking to you, even if what they are telling you does not require you to give a response. 

After someone speaks to you over the radio simply state something such as “Roger” to let them know that you have heard what they had to say and understand it. 

Should you fail to hear what someone said or did not quite understand what they were saying do not be afraid to say something such as “*You* this is *me*, repeat last” at which point the previous speaker should restate their message to you.
### Initiating and responding to calls

This is just about the most important piece of radio etiquette, initiating a call with another unit properly. 

To do this is very simple; simply say “*You* this is *me*.” <br>If someone is calling you over the radio, but you do not have time to listen to whatever they need to say due to combat or some other pressing matters do not be afraid to respond with “*You* this is *me*, wait.” 

Once you have the ability to listen to what they need to tell you though, do not forget to re-initiate the conversation with “*You* this is *me*” at which point they must now acknowledge you before you proceed to inquire about what they wanted to tell you.

## Communications procedures

You may be called upon to use the command net or emergency net at some point.<br>
When doing so you need to know the following communications protocols

1.	Generic radio message
2.	Contact report
3.	Enemy sighted report
4.	Situation report (SITREP)

### Generic radio message

All radio messages between group leaders use a very simple communications protocol.

When broadcasting over radios, ALWAYS state your callsign then the recipient callsign ("Alpha to XRay")

When the recipient party acknowledged your transmission, you can broadcast your message, keeping it as concise as possible.<br>
Command comms typically goes on in Command chat, which unless you are the group leader, you won’t hear.

If your squad leader goes down and you are next in line for command, it is your responsibility to contact command and let them know your current situation (keep in mind your yellow smokes too).<br>
However you will not be able to do this on command net because you will not be the group leader

The easiest way to transmit this information is to tell your medic ground, who can relay the priority to command.<br>
Do NOT be afraid of "*breaking*" comms when an emergency is going on.
Please do keep in mind to announce "<font color="orange">**BREAK, BREAK, EMERGENCY**</font>" before broadcasting the emergency on any radio channel.

### Contact report

A contact report is given the moment you get into contact, it is done without delay on command net or emergency net, if you are temporarily in charge. 

> <font color="yellow">*It takes priority over any other message and does not wait for the command net current comms to stop.*</font>

This then informs command that your squad has just entered into a firefight and may need assistance shortly, so he can start preparing a support plan for you.<br>
It also aids in situational awareness, if you were to go down a moment later, and had not issued a contact report, he would not know you were having problems.

Once you have settled into the firefight, then you can give a more detailed report on your current situation.

### Enemy sighted report

You would use an enemy sighted report to update command on enemies that you have seen but are not in contact with.<br>
You would need to give detailed info and already have marked the enemy position on the map. (Do not spam markers, use text as much as possible, with time and directions if able)

### Situation report (SITREP)

This is used to quickly get information on something specific. Let's say for example, the Mission commander wants to know how much AT each squad has or the general ammo situation in squads, to know if a resupply is needed.<br>
This then requires the squad leader to get the information out of his squad. 

Another SITREP used is the medical report. This ensure a way for the platoon medic to know exactly the conditions of the squads, and if an emergency is going on.<br>
A platoon medic will ask all the combat life savers for a **MEDREP** (MEDical REPort), then the CLS will do a roll call on their squads.
