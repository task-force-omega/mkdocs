# Task Force Omega player's handbook

> **This is a document designed to accompany the Task Force Omega Mission Series.** 
> 
> *In it, you will find a quick reference for some of the most basic information you will need in order to function effectively on the TFO Server.*

## General attitude and approach

You are part of a bigger picture and a member of a team. In Task Force Omega, we encourage people to keep teamplay in mind.

Every squad will be tasked with something, and it isn’t your job to second guess your squad leader or to carry out tasks given to other squads. 

You will not have the bigger picture if you do not have access to command net. 
So, do not take it upon yourself to implement your own ideas without the say so of the squad leader.

**You need to think and prepare before you act.**

## Basic DO's and DON'Ts

It really is an abridged version of Task Force Omega rules, available <a href="/mkdocs/rulebook/">here</a>.

### DO

- Respect fellow players, no matter the circumstance
- Stay close to your group, unless told otherwise
- If you have an issue, speak to an admin, don't try to solve it yourself
- Carry out the orders given to you by your squad leaders
- Focus, think, and prepare before you act


### DON'T

- Initiate contact without the say so of the squad leader (apply ROE)
- Scavenge bodies for equipment unless asked to do so
- Take enemy weapons without permission
- Spam markers on the map
- Respond to a teamkill, by teamkilling

## SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)

Although SOP is covered during your **B**asic **C**ombat **T**raining, a refresher is always welcome.

## ROE

This is as much a mindset as it is a rule of engagement.

In other words, if the ROE is red, you should be doing everything in your power to remain covert and unseen.

## Advanced Combat Radio Environment 2 (ACRE2) Usage


In order to achieve the best tactical experience in Arma3, Task Force Omega uses ACRE2 as the main radio communication tool during the events.

*As it is installed by Steam, the add-on will be added to Teamspeak plugins library automatically.*

(all below is WIP)
### Brevity and clean communications

Once the conversation has been initiated, keep your message simple and short. Think of what you’re going to say before you begin to transmit over the radios, do not “umm” and “uhh” over the radio. Keep it brief, no more than 10-15 seconds maximum. 

If you lose your train of thoughts while speaking over radio, simply state “Wait one” and take a moment to collect your thoughts before re-initiating the conversation. Also stay out of the coms if there are no important things, use direct chat. 

Remember, keep it brief and clear, keep it brief and clear, and keep it brief and clear.

### Acknowledging speakers

Make sure you always acknowledge the person who is speaking to you, even if what they are telling you does not require you to give a response. 

After someone speaks to you over the radio simply state something such as “Roger” to let them know that you have heard what they had to say and understand it. 

Should you fail to hear what someone said or did not quite understand what they were saying do not be afraid to say something such as “*You* this is *me*, repeat last” at which point the previous speaker should restate their message to you.
### Initiating and responding to calls

This is just about the most important piece of radio etiquette, initiating a call with another unit properly. 

To do this is very simple; simply say “*You* this is *me*.” <br>If someone is calling you over the radio, but you do not have time to listen to whatever they need to say due to combat or some other pressing matters do not be afraid to respond with “*You* this is *me*, wait.” 

Once you have the ability to listen to what they need to tell you though, do not forget to re-initiate the conversation with “*You* this is *me*” at which point they must now acknowledge you before you proceed to inquire about what they wanted to tell you.
